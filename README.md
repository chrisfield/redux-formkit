Light-weight React components making it easy to write html forms connected to the Redux store. Includes validation, field-arrays and access to the valid/not-valid form status as fields are changed.


## Getting Started
`npm install --save redux-formkit`

Try the [redux-formkit examples](https://github.com/chrisfield/formapp). They run with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and are easy to clone, install, start and edit.
